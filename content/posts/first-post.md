I've been doing many things for the last year or so, built a ton of prototype projects, learned Python, tried out tauri v2 alpha (it's now been several months since the stable release), played around with AI Agents, and more. I've thought about making videos about them but either because I didn't think they'd be useful enough or the hassle of recording and editing a video was too much, I never got around to it. I've also been working on an online course platform, the development of which was fun and I could've documented, but again, I never did. So this is what I hope to do with this blog: document my journey, share my knowledge, and hopefully help others along the way.
